# üõ† Ethos
> An agency-increasing toolkit for Ethereum developers.

## üí° Features

- Built-in node capable of connecting to most networks available
- Compile and deploy Solidity ("smart contracts") code to any compatible network

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

To use Ethos, the following tools are **required**:

1. #### [Task][1]

If you have Go installed, installing Task is as easy as running: 
```bash
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
```

2. #### [Solidity Compiler][2]

For now, to build and compile Solidity source code we rely on
an external compiler, which should ideally be either **solc** or **solcjs**.

For the purpose of these instructions, the choice will be **solc** (in this
case, under a system running Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install solc
```

3. #### [Abigen][3] 

This tool is part of the Ethereum devtools package. 

If you have Go installed, this is as easy as running:

```bash
go install github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/abigen
```
